# Big-O Notation

> `log(n)` is faaaaar better than constant `n`

is something to (always) keep at the back of your head.

When writing code
- look for nested loops
- look for "indirect" nested loops, hidden within function calls
- consider the input size ("n")
- `log(n)` is faaaaar better than constant `n`

No need to be too sciency about it, but quickly think it through.
Most of the time it is far easier to optimize these while coding instead of a refactor.

Try to prevent **premature optimization**, but don't neglect the impact it might have.
