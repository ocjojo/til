#  Beginner Tips

I gathered, since I am a beginner myself.
Terms/expressions are mostly picked up or made up according to my understanding :D

## Movements
Film with intention.

  - rarely pan between subjects
  - instead
    - move in or out
    - slide
    - rotate around a subject

## Position

- lower/near ground to make more impressive/grander shots

## Storyline

- Beginning: Move in from macro to micro to capture viewer
- Ending: move out; release the viewer
